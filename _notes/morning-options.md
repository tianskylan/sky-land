I have tried many versions of morning routines that I learned from different people that I look up to. Wake up early, meditate, exercise, go for a walk in nature, read a book, write morning pages, and on. They are great, but I often feel I'm not in control. I'm living someone else's life.

So instead, I gathered these learnings and built a **morning options** for myself. I try to wake up early, but I never set an alarm. After that, I ask myself what do I want to do the most? The answer changes from week to week. Sometimes I start my day meditating, while other times I dive right into morning pages because I had these interesting thoughts floating in my head.

This doesn't mean I'm not forming good habits - I make sure all my morning options are good according to my standards. This gives me more autonomy and freedom. After all, I don't want to be a freaking robot.
