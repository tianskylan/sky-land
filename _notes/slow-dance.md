Here's a poem that I enjoyed and would like to repost below.

# Slow Dance
*David L Weatherform*

Have you ever watched kids</br>
On a merry-go-round?

Or listened to the rain</br>
Slapping on the ground?

Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight?</br>
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?

You better slow down.</br>
Don’t dance so fast.

Time is short.</br>
The music won’t last.

Do you run through each day,</br>
On the fly?

When you ask: How are you?</br>
Do you hear the reply?

When the day is done,</br>
do you lie in your bed

With the next hundred chores,</br>
Running through your head?

You’d better slow down.</br>
Don’t dance so fast.

Time is short.</br>
The music won’t last.

Ever told your child,</br>
We’ll do it tomorrow?

And in your haste,</br>
Not see his sorrow?

Ever lost touch,</br>
Let a good friendship die.

Cause you never had time</br>
To call and say, "Hi"?

You’d better slow down.</br>
Don’t dance so fast.

Time is short.</br>
The music won’t last.

When you run so fast to get somewhere,</br>
You miss half the fun of getting there.

When you worry and hurry through your day,</br>
It is like an unopened gift thrown away.

Life is not a race.</br>
Do take it slower.

Hear the music,</br>
Before the song is over.
