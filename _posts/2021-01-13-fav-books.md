# 2020 Books
2020 was a bad year in many ways, but at least it created some time for reading. Goodreads shows that I read 44 books in 2020, ranging from 88 pages to 707 pages.

Here are 14 of those books that I'd like to recommend to you.


## 1. Poor Charlie's Almanack

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Charles-Expanded/dp/1578645018/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&keywords=poor+Charlie%27s+almanack&qid=1610602521&sr=8-1&linkCode=li2&tag=skyland01-20&linkId=ac6bf7339ae7b6a14d2deccf5ea7e35b&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1578645018&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=skyland01-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=skyland01-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=1578645018" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Charlie Munger's worldly wisdom compiled in one book. If you are interested in mental models, investing, first principle thinking, no bullshit communication, this is a great book to pick up.

## 2. Exhalation

A collection of short Sci-fi stories from the great author Ted Chiang. My favorite story in the book was "The Merchant and the Alchemist’s Gate". Fascinating storyline and beautiful writing.

## 3. Amusing Ourselves to Death

In the age of endless entertainment, the arguments and warnings in this 40+ year old book are becoming even more relevant today. It made me think more deeply about McLuhan's idea "the medium is the message".

## 4. Alchemy
I tend to think of myself as a "logical person". Now I realize I'm quite naive to think that. 

> "This book is not an attack on the many healthy uses of logic or reason, but it is an attack on a dangerous kind of logical overreach, which demands that every solution should have a convincing rationale before it can even be considered or attempted. If this book provides you with nothing else, I hope it gives you permission to suggest slightly silly things from time to time."

## 5. 何为良好生活
> 「要自我实现，得有个自我，如果我年复一年奋斗，最后把自我丢失了，那不算自我实现。但反过来，成天自我自我，把个自我想象成一只肥皂泡，五彩斑斓，圆润完整，也不是自我实现。一个人所做的事情使他充盈，支持他站立，面包师傅把面包烤得香喷喷的，医生把病人治好，自我由之实现。从前，只有俊杰之士才谈得上自我实现，如今，我们人人都要自我实现。的确，在有些国度，人们似乎不像我们天朝人，但凡有一线机会就把欲穿的望眼投向挣大钱当大官，他当个小学老师或社区医生，也过得蛮充实蛮高兴。」

## 6. How to Take Smart Notes
I discovered Roam Research in 2020, which eventually led me to this wonderful book. The title talks about note taking, but it's really more about building a bottom-up writing system. It teaches you why writing can help you think, and provides a practical guide on how to do that.

## 7. Hell yea or no
Derek Sivers has a super power to cut through all the things that doesn't matter and preserve what's essential in life. I published my notes on this book [here](https://www.tianskylan.com/hell-yeah-or-no-book-notes).

## 8. On writing well
This book was recommended to me on my freshmen year by my writing professor. I didn't pay attention then, but finally read it in 2 020 as I start to learn to write better. The book is highly regarded for a reason. My favorite part is on the principle of simplicity and declutter. So many Internet writing could be half as long. More notes [here](https://www.tianskylan.com/on-writing-well-book-notes).

## 9. Sum
40 beautiful short stories about the after life, witty and thought provoking. The perspectives it provided about life and death are super fun to think about.  I'm grateful for discovering this book through @photomatt on a podcast.

## 10. Man's Search for Meaning
This book had helped me through some of the lowest times of 2020. All of us probably suffered to some extent last year, yet Frankl tells us suffering can bring meaning too. "Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.".

## 11. The Psychology of Money
Some of my favorite writing on risks and personal finance of 2020. Many people chase money without knowing what game they are playing. Optimizing for "most money possible" may not even be your game. Don't blindly copy someone else's game.

## 12. Vagabonding
This book talks a lot about traveling and adventure. "But beyond travel, vagabonding is an outlook on life. Vagabonding is about using the prosperity and possibility of the information age to increase your personal options instead of your personal possessions. Vagabonding is about looking for adventure in normal life, and normal life within adventure. Vagabonding is an attitude—a friendly interest in people, places, and things that makes a person an explorer in the truest, most vivid sense of the word."

## 13. The Almanack of Naval Ravikant
This is a nice curation of the wisdom shared by Naval. I loved the fresh perspectives on health, wealth and wisdom. These insights have largely influenced my decision making in 2020, and advice I give to my friends. "Today, I believe happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life."

## 14. Digital Minimalism
I've been on practicing some form of "digital minimalism" for years now, like cutting down on social media and screen time in general. "As argued, our current unease with new technologies is not really about whether or not they’re useful. It’s instead about autonomy."
